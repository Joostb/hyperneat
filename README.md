# Plan
We want to implement HyperNeat.
According to the paper [1], we will have to implement NEAT[4,5] first, or use an existing NEAT implementation.


# Some relevant papers:


 1. The original HyperNeat Paper. It is really long (30 pages), the first 13 pages are about the theory behind Hyperneat, after that it's just about experiments. <br>
   http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/stanley_alife09.pdf

 2. Hyperneat applied on Atari games, also long (18 pages) and not really indepth on the implementation, but might be nice for trainining tips. <br>

 3. A paper that uses hyperneat to classify MNIST digits with horrible results ðŸ™ƒ. <br>

 5. Followup to the NEAT paper (quote: "Each of the 33 evolution runs took between 5 and 10 days on a 1GHz Pentium III processor,
depending on the progress of evolution and sizes of the networks involved"): <br>
